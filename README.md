Scripts
----
* **INPUT**

It contains `R` scripts for analyse the input dataset (gene and exon datasets). It is used for performing descriptive statistics (median, countâ€¦), and calculate a standard measure of dispersion of our data (calculate ranges).     

* **PROCESSING**

Prepare the input data for DFE-alpha (includes two`perl` and a `bash` script for concatening the coding regions according to the empirical distribution of the features of interest) and a `bash` script for running the program. 

* **ANALYSIS**

Estimate K<sub>Z+</sub>, K<sub>Z-/0</sub> and K<sub>S</sub> from the DFE-alpha output and statistic analysis with R. It includes a `perl` script for transform the DFE-output and calculate these values. The statistic analysis is performed with `R` scripts.  

* **GRAPHS**

Matrix correlation graphs and other stuff. It includes some `png` examples.
